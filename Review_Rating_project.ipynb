      "Product is worth for price. But I ordered and got replacement done multiple times for cushion as cushion has holes on each product and that makes cushion life less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2\n",

      " The wifi signals are super strong on both channels, i highly recommend this router. Loving it. Thanks upvSales\\n\\nUpdate after 3 months\\n\\nThis has started to hang with heavy usage.\\nThe system light on router stops blinking and the only solution is to restart the router.\\n\\nThis happens daily several times under heavy downloading.\\n\\nI get 98mbps to my LAN connected laptop, but this frequent hang issue is very annoying.\\n\\nApart from this hang issue, no other problems.\\n\\nYou can look at the video when it hangs, the system light goes out of sync, can't even log into the router.\\nNormally the system light blinks at normal intervals.\\nNo service center's in my area also.
